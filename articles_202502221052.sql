He returned to report that he saw Mr. Banjo''s driver using his car as taxi!<br>When they \"reported\" his driver to him, he said he was aware- that was why he hired a driver. Why park a car for 6-8 hours, when it can be making money for you?</em></blockquote><blockquote><em>The other teachers were stunned: suddenly, he didn''t look as stupid as they thought! </em></blockquote><blockquote><em>Now, because of the extra income from using his car as a taxi, he was able to pay back the loan in a year...</em></blockquote><blockquote><em>By the 2nd year, he bought a 2nd car to add to his taxi fleet...</em></blockquote><blockquote><em>By the 3rd year, he bought 2 more taxis...</em></blockquote><blockquote><em>By the 4th year when my mum &amp; others finished paying their loans, this guy had 6 taxis!</em></blockquote><blockquote><em>Then he bought a brand new Opel Kadett, the newer model!<br>Other cars were 4 years old...<br>My mum said, that was the moment they realised who was smart &amp; who was foolish among them all.</em></blockquote><p>This happened between 1965-1970.</p><p>Today, there are too many folks more interested in spending the money they don''t have to buy the things they don''t need and impress people who don''t like them.</p><p>Here''s a little personal tip.

And the little daily actions that make large changes in the wealth of people, companies &amp; nations!</p><blockquote>A country is in for trouble when its ruler is childish, and its leaders party all day long.<br></blockquote><h2 id=\"dec-2009\">Dec. 2009 </h2><p>At 5:00 am, a teenage boy of 17 Years, visibly shaken rushes his sister to the hospital. She was in perilous pain and coughing thick pale blood clots. In the last few months, she had repeated excruciating pain in the abdomen. However, in the last 5 days, the pains had intensified with an inability to sleep, and intermittent drowsiness. As she sat sprawled on a maligned bench, her bones were visible across her now whitish skin.<br>At the Gbagada Hospital, very few people roamed the lobby. The nurse on duty had requested a registration fee before admission. The amount required was a paltry 1,000 NGN (2.3 USD). The teenager had braced this fear to make a last-ditch effort to save her life at the hospital. His sister had resisted being brought to the hospital. Hope and despair had been the fortitude for his action; hope that a good Samaritan would chance by, and despair that there is a chance she could be snatched from the feet of the grim-reaper.<br>Born and inherited from a lineage of poverty, they could barely afford a meal daily. Less the cost of registration. All alternatives administered to her‚Ää‚Äî‚ÄäLocal Herbs, Prayers &amp; Fasting, Self medications and anticipating a miracle, exacerbated the pain and worsened her state.<br>Their dad, an attendant in an eatery, had been owed six months of wages. Their mom, a local ‚Äòogi &amp; akamu seller‚Äô, had borrowed so much from the neighbors that, doors were slammed shut at the sight of her. The family owed everyone in the neighborhood, including the local ‚Äòolo de‚Äô (security man) with whom they lent the money for the ‚Äòokada ride‚Äô to the Gbagada hospital. <br>The young boy, alone and red-eyed in tears, begged, pleaded, and wailed that his sister be attended to. She was losing pulse and it was unsure how long she would last. <br>The Nurse, looking in sympathy at an almost lifeless sister, was out of options. Just last week, she received a query and fine for attending to a patient who had left without clearing their bills. Now she was going to paying the bills spread over six months. It stung her that a good intention would reduce her meager take home and a red in her file. And she vowed never to make a second trip to the ‚Äògood Samaritan lane‚Äô ever! She insisted‚Ää‚Äî‚Ää‚ÄòNo Money, No treatment‚Äô. <br>Now his wails were beginning to awake a few patients. The physician on duty had also rung the reception demanding that order be restored! As the pandemonium of his cries escalated into a scene, the security men were called in to whisk his sickly lifeless sister and himself off the premises of the hospital.<br>Then a middle-aged woman walked in. She had come in earlier than expected for a routine check-up. Listening to his story, she told the nurse to put the bills on her on file. This good samaritan was indeed God-sent. Prayers Answered!<br>5 hours since she was brought in, and two hours since she was whisked into the operating room, there was still no word from the operating theater. His mother had arrived then. There, they sat, hands held together in prayers, awaiting the news of a successful operation. <br>A few minutes later, clandestinely, the doctor walked in. He apologized and explained <em>in hush tones </em>‚ÄòWe tried all we could. She had lost too much blood. The malignant growth had eaten her organs. I am sorry, but your daughter did not make it!.‚Äô The coursing of a thousand cries between mother and brother ripped several reverberations across the hospital. <br>That day, he vowed that he would never forgive himself for the poverty of his family in a nation so wretched to be a citizen of!</p><hr><h2 id=\"june-1961-\">June. 1961. </h2><p>Ed Lorenz, a meteorologist &amp; mathematician, was using a simple digital computer to simulate weather patterns. He configured 12 modeling variables (equations) representing atmospheric elements like Wind, Temperature, and Speed. After the initial experiment, he wanted to repeat the sequence of data. And so made the intuitive decision to start in the middle of its course.<br>He entered a printout of the data corresponding to the middle of the original simulation. Alas, the machine printed numbers completely misaligned to the previous calculation. <br>His fortuitous Error: the rounded decimal in the computer printout. His computer worked with 6 digit precision. However, his printout rounded the variables into 3 digit-numbers. The difference between the computer output (0.506127) and the paper printout (0.506) was tiny and hence should have no practical effect as the consensus was at the time. <br>However, he discovered that small differences in the initial states of complex systems can lead to massive differences. Prof. Ed determined that this small change in initial conditions, which lead to a large change in long-term outcomes, be called ¬†<em>Sensitive Dependence on initial conditions</em>. <br>His work would go on to open a new field in Quantum Physics and earn him the Kyoto Prize (Japan‚Äôs highest private award for lifetime achievement in the arts and sciences)for basic sciences almost 3 decades later.</p><hr><h2 id=\"feb-2nd-2020-\">Feb 2nd 2020.</h2><blockquote>News Flash: Davido''s Brother has a luxury wedding in Dubai as HushPuppy Sprays rolls of Hundred Dollar Notes. </blockquote><p>In his home country, he was born with an unmissable inheritance; poverty. The struggles of his parents and their inability to cater for his siblings ; the death of his sister because of a lack of 1000; his hard work and the challenges he had faced gaining education or the pursuit of happiness; culminated in his decision to leave <em>Naija </em>for ‚Äògreener pastures.‚Äô <br>Born into hardship, shaped by struggles and succeeding by determination, hook or crook. His sojourn into foreign land had proved fortuitous. He had now taken residence first at Malaysia and most recently, the United Arab Emirates. Albeit successfully. <br>He was an internet celebrity known for his lavish lifestyle. He lived at Palazzo Versace, a quite expensive &amp; super-luxurious hotel in Dubai. His IG handle is stuffed to suffocation with exquisite and expensive items; super-luxury cars, top range designer labels, expensive watches, top of the range clothes, bling-bling, and items of rare quality. <br>In fact, he had the moniker, ‚Äò the Billionaire Gucci Master‚Äô on one of his social handles. Who would argue the billionaire status? He had escaped the ‚ÄòNigerian Struggle‚Äô to live ‚ÄòThe Gucci Life‚Äô. Even the Nigeria elite reveled in his popularity. He hobnobbed with super-celebrities; being one in his own right with a verified Instagram account and 2.5 million followers. His Instagram giveaways were unrivaled, having his followers wait on his every post like the man at the pool of Bethesda; usually in hundred dollar bills. His likes &amp; comments per post could reach as much as 200k‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääa 9% click-through rate.<br>What‚Äôs more, he was acknowledged for his patronage with designer labels. On his birthday, October, 11, one of the top-notch designer labels, Fendi, sent a massive cake with his picture and various products shopping bags carved into the cake. <em>He had made his money as a Real Estate Developer investing across multiple countries and in various income-producing assets. </em>Ray Hushppuppi was now living ‚ÄòLa Vida Loca‚Äô (The Rich Crazy Life).</p><hr><h2 id=\"dec-29-1972-\">Dec 29. 1972.</h2><p>Professor Lorenzo went on to present his finding to his colleagues. He was scorned. His paper, presented to the American Association for the Advancement of Science was titled; <em>Predictability: Does the flap of a butterfly‚Äôs wings in Brazil set off a tornado in Texas?</em><br>In the paper, he explained that minuscule disturbances neither increase nor decrease the frequency of various weather patterns. However, they could modify the sequence in which these events occur. He asked the question then that ‚Äò<em>Is the behavior of the atmosphere unstable with respect to perturbations of small amplitude?‚Äô </em>In giving an answer, he theorized that the inability to predict accurately weather patterns sufficiently in a distant future time is based on how small perturbations that can lead to complex changes in weather patterns. He penned a few conclusions: <br>1. Small errors in the coarser structure of weather patterns‚Ää‚Äî‚Äätend to double every three days. <br>2. Small errors in the finer structure tend to grow more rapidly, doubling in hours or less. <br>3. Errors in the finer structure (1) having attained appreciable size, tend to induce errors in the coarser structure (2). <br>4. Certain special weather quantities‚Ää‚Äî‚Äälike weekly average temperature or total rainfall‚Ää‚Äî‚Äämay be predictable at a range at which entire weather patterns are not. <br>Prof Lorenzo concluded in his paper that although the original question ‚ÄòDoest the Flap of a butterfly wing in Brazil cause a Tornado in Texas‚Äô‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääwas still unanswered, it is maintained that the atmosphere is unstable because of finer &amp; coarser structure in atmospheric element‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääincluding the flap of a butterfly!</p><hr><h2 id=\"july-3-2020\">July 3, 2020</h2><p><em> ‚ÄòRamon Olorunwa Abbas, 37, a.k.a. ‚ÄúRay Hushpuppi‚Äù and ‚ÄúHush,‚Äù a Nigerian national, arrived in Chicago Thursday evening after being expelled from the United Arab Emirates (UAE)‚Äô </em>reads a complaint from the Department of Justice, US Attorney‚Äôs office for the Central district of California. <br>On the 24th of June, the FBI &amp; Interpol had raided Hushpuppi and his gang in a sting called <em>Operation Fox Hunt 2 </em>.

He was arrested along with 11 other African cyber criminals. It was alleged that they had defrauded almost 2 million victims. <br>The FBI &amp; Interpol corporation as well as the Dubai Police planned the operation, flawlessly. The complaint filed on the department of justice affirmed that he had been tracked using social media; namely email, IG, and Snapchat accounts. His flamboyancy left a trail of evidence that was used to link him to the alleged crime. He was arrested and extradited to the United States.

            "html": "<hr><p>The <s>Easy</s> Hard Way to build a business in Nigeria. How to turn ¬†250,000 USD into 250 billion USD in net-worth like Jeff Bezos.</p><blockquote>It is useless to get up early and to stay up late, eating the food of exhausting labor‚Äî truly he gives sleep to those he loves.</blockquote><p>Anyone who has been running a business in Nigeria for more than 5 years has survived what 90% of most businesses don''t do. Statistics say most businesses fail within the first 3 years, but in Nigeria, many don''t survive the first few months.</p><p>Doing business in Nigeria is like screening a season of the Game of Thrones. Suddenly, your business can be murdered by the Tagaryens‚Ää‚Äî‚ÄäPolice Officers, Lannisters‚Ää‚Äî‚ÄäAgbero Boys, Starks‚Ää‚Äî‚ÄäTax Men, Tyrells‚Ää‚Äî‚ÄäBad Vendors or Baratheons‚Ää‚Äî‚ÄäPotholes, No Electricity, Lack of Infrastructure. And after the death of your business, the plot and twists just keep on in the towns of Westeros, Essos, and Sothoryos‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääyour customers.</p><p>But if you were to ask us‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääwho have survived like Jon Snow‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääabout the quick steps to entrepreneurial success in our nation, follow these steps.</p><ol><li>Hustle Like a Drop Out</li><li>Live Super-Frugally.</li><li>Work like a Donkey</li><li>Stay teachable &amp; humble</li><li>See Failure as an event.</li></ol><p>If when you finish reading this, you still think the steps are quick, then please don''t start a business yet! üòâ</p><p>We would speak to each one now!</p><p><strong>1. Hustle like a dropout, but first, keep your certificate away.</strong></p><p>See, as folks who finished from the most prestigious institution in this country,‚Ää‚Äî‚Ää<em>no bragging rights intended</em>‚Ää‚Äî‚Ää there is little about your ¬†certificate that qualifies for success as an entrepreneur in Nigeria.</p><p>You want to make money, init? Keep your certificate under your bed or just forget it exists entirely.</p><p>1st, 2nd, 3rd Class or No Class, doesn‚Äôt matter. Your lessons are learned as a hustler. Your courses are taken on the road. Your pass or failure is your daily survival.</p><p>Nigeria is a country where Graduates are earning 50k (or less) in air-conditioned offices, whereas school dropouts are cleaning 500k selling in the open spaces of Obalende market.</p><p>Certificates confuse you as to what you should earn‚Ää‚Äî‚Ää<em>assa </em>a 1st Class I should earn min. 500k.</p><p>Hustling establishes what you need to survive‚Äî hustle at all cost, from dawn to dusk.</p><ul><li>Your queen‚Äôs English must be replaced with Pidgin, Yoruba, Igbo &amp; Hausa.</li><li>Your well-ironed shirts must be replaced with wash and dry clothes.</li><li>Your latest iPhone XI must be replaced with <em>palasa </em>Nokia phone with battery that sustains for a week.</li></ul><blockquote>Test: Have you ever hustled your way so much so that people confused you for a low-brow uneducated person? If you do, welcome to the hustle club.</blockquote><p><br></p><p><strong>2. Live Frugally! You don‚Äôt need new dresses in your wardrobe.</strong></p><p>Frugality is the king of survival in Lagos. All those Uber to every meeting; eating in ‚ÄòThe Place‚Äô; having Coldstone ice cream and a movie every weekend is for people earning a lot of their employers money‚Ää‚Äî‚ÄäEmployees.</p><p>As an entrepreneur, you just bike/<em>molue </em>to deliver your orders; eat <em>boli </em>with groundnut as lunch; enjoy your meals without even <em>pomo</em>.</p><p>That‚Äôs the way of the frugal entrepreneur. Not that you won‚Äôt afford and have those things later. But the sacrifice to survive and keep your business afloat makes those as luxuries, now. Just Now!</p><p>YOu must learn to cut costs, eliminate waste and do little with much. You don''t need to always run the generator. You cant afford to be using data to watch irrelevant youtube videos. With your little shop, you can serve customers across Nigeria.</p><p><strong><em>Costs Kill Fast. Sales Cure All. Keep Frugal Always.</em></strong></p><blockquote>Test: have you ever gotten to a point where you bank account looks like JAMB score; like 232?</blockquote><p><strong>3. Work like a Jackal, sleeping 6 hours is sometimes a luxury.</strong></p><p>Lagos is the only country, and we can argue that where there is traffic gridlock from 5 am till 1 am.</p><p>There is nothing about Lagos that is gentle. From the time you come out of your house, if you don‚Äôt have neighbors with ‚Äò<em>i beta pass gen‚Äô</em>, till you return, it is a noisy cantankerous fast-paced movie.</p><p>Say, you have an appointment at 10 am on the Island, you must leave the house at 6 am latest if you stay on the mainland. Sometimes, as early as 4:30 am if you stay at the hinterland‚Ää‚Äî<em>‚ÄäAbule Egba, Mowe, Ajah</em>. Incase you dont know, Lagos traffic is a citizen of Lagos with all rights and priveleges appertaining to a tax player! Don''t mess with Lagos Traffic.</p><p>The hard work in Lagos, just as an employee is insanely intense. People leave their homes at 5am and return at 9pm earliest. A <em>9 am to 5</em> <em>pm </em>job has been turned to a <em>5 am to 9 pm </em>lifestyle.</p><p>But as an entrepreneur, you have to work harder and stay longer. Think about all you need to do as an entrepreneur: call clients, converse for business, handle the traffic, fulfill customer orders, keep tabs on all your social media channels, manage your vendors, and still keep safe against <em>agbero </em>boys.</p><p>Well, if you are doing all these things and more to keep your business afloat, you wouldn‚Äôt be sleeping excessively.</p><blockquote>Test : have you woken up somedays only to be more tired than you slept?</blockquote><p><br></p><p>4. <strong>Stay Teachable, you don‚Äôt learn anything by talking</strong>.</p><p>Everyone has an opinion about everything in Lagos. Ask any average Nigerian what is wrong with the country, and you get a sermon from them. But no one makes money from complaining about itthings. Money is made by observing, learning, asking questions and staying humble all along.</p><p>You just never ever ever know it all in business.</p><p>You would meet all kinds of interesting people in your entrepreneurial journey-land: policemen asking you for your laptop‚Äôs receipt bought 3 years ago; tax officers for taxes in 3 month old business; Molue guys shouting at when they owe you <em>change.</em></p><p>But keep the teachable spirit and stay unprovoked. You would always amazed at the opportunities that lie lurking in daylight‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääeveryone talks about it, no one is doing anything about it.</p><p>The most profitable businesses in Nigeria are from flashes of insight on the daily trends of our challenges‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääask Mr. Dangote who sells sugar &amp; cement, Mr. Adenuga who sells recharge cards or Mr. Pedro who sells oil &amp; gas.</p><blockquote>Test : Have you noticed that it‚Äôs easier to collect 10 naira from 1000 people than to collect 1000 naira from 10 people?</blockquote><p><br></p><p>5. <strong>Failure is an event, not an inheritance from your lineage.</strong></p><p>It is common to hear our superstitious generation say, every failure is a curse from some grandparents and generational umbilical cord. People go on mountains and stay under the sea to remove failure from their life.</p><p>Well, look again, if there is any nation that needs to be cursed, it should be the Germans. The Germans murdered millions of God‚Äôs people, the Jews during WWII, yet today, they are the 4th largest economy in the world with a 4.2 trillion USD. About 10x that of Nigeria.</p><p>Were Germany Nigeria, where would be? You bet, we would still be in the dark ages blaming our ancestors for killing the Jews as the reason for our low standard of living, bad roads and corrupt leaders.</p><p>Enough of that Nonsense! No one is responsible for the outcomes of your life‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääfailure or sucess‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääsave yourself!</p><p>Own your failure, it is an event that happens at a point in time, not an inheritance from any parental ‚Äòbad belle‚Äô. No one is to blame for your failures. But beyond that, don‚Äôt let your failures keep you down! Just dust the back of your sleeves, learn the lessons and forget the details.</p><p>We can guarantee you, in Nigeria, you would fail alotttttt. We mean, a whole lot raised to power 3. But keep pushing forward. Keep keeping on and never say never, irrespective of what you face.</p><p>But failure is a snapshot, so keep the pictures of it out of your live and keep recording the good moments.</p><p><strong>Live Forward. Dont look backward.</strong></p><blockquote>Test: have you ever gotten to a point where you swore to yourself that you would give up. Only to wake up in the morning and promise to fire on?</blockquote><p><br></p><p>Well, those are the 5 <s>quick</s> steps to entrepreneurial success. We would be glad to share in your story?</p><hr><p>Moyotician is the founder and senior tutor of the Lifematics center.

Create Stretch Net-worth Challenges</strong><br>Nothing keeps the brain working like stretching it to reach difficult ¬†goals. You can have yearly net-worth goals broken down to monthly and quarterly marks. For instance - a goal to increase your net-worth by 1,000,000 in year could be broken down to 90,000 monthly challenges and 300,00 quarterly challenges.<br>These would challenge you to look for smart-earned money and push you beyond your comfort zone. </p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"https://nairasense.investnaira.com/content/images/2020/07/image.png\" class=\"kg-image\"><figcaption>Staying Wealthy</figcaption></figure><p>3. <strong>Change your circle of friendship<br></strong>Nothing influences us more than our environments.

For the Next Pandemic!</em></p><p>Really, the biggest effect of this pandemic is the massive holes, that we have often ignored, that were revealed in a big way. As at this time of writing, there are 4.64million cases worldwide (5,959 in Nigeria) with three hundred and twelve thousand deaths - 182 in Nigeria. (Updated for May 18th) <br><br></p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/675/1*A4TdNqGI0YvcPhTDSgUDvg.png\" class=\"kg-image\"><figcaption>COVID-19 Case Update (Nigeria)</figcaption></figure><p>And yet I maintain that it is not the biggest impact. The biggest impact was in realizing how unprepared Nigeria was for a pandemic. How the health sector wasn‚Äôt well equipped initially, the great difficulty in providing social welfare by the government, and the level of extreme dependency of a large portion of Nigeria on their monthly income.</p><p>These are some of the issues that we have always known on some level but were made obvious by the situation. There are many more issues, for example, the fact that we had to create a campaign reminding people to have the level of basic hygiene that we should have already known from home economics classes was rather disturbing.</p><blockquote>the health sector wasn‚Äôt well equipped initially, the great difficulty in providing social welfare by the government, and the level of extreme dependency of a large portion of Nigeria on their monthly income</blockquote><h3 id=\"the-noah-s-rule\"><strong>THE NOAH‚ÄôS RULE</strong></h3><p>But challenges are pointers to areas that need improvement and here at <a href=\"http://InvestNaira.com/Signup\" rel=\"noopener\">InvestNaira </a>we have come up with some of the lessons that everyone needs to learn in handling their finances. Over the next couple of weeks we‚Äôd be looking at the tips at length, helping to increase your financial intelligence.</p><p>Today we‚Äôll be looking at the first, and in my opinion, the most important lesson; <strong><em>The need for an emergency fund</em></strong>. To illustrate this, I will be drawing parallels between this current situation and a very common bible story that a lot of us should have heard of. The story of Noah.</p><blockquote><strong>The Noah Rule</strong> says: ‚ÄúPredicting rain doesn‚Äôt count, building an <strong>ark</strong> does.‚Äù <br>(Warren Buffet‚Ää‚Äî‚Ää2001 Shareholder Letter)</blockquote><p>For those who don‚Äôt know the story I‚Äôll briefly summarize. God was going to send a flood to destroy the world due to the high level of evil that the people were exhibiting. But He decided to spare Noah because he did right in his sight. So he was instructed to build an ark for himself, his family and two (male and female) out of every living thing. The floods came and the ones who survived were those who were within the ark.</p><p><strong>How Does Building A Noah‚Äôs Ark Affect Finance?</strong></p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-embed-card kg-card-hascaption\"><blockquote class=\"instagram-media\" data-instgrm-captioned data-instgrm-permalink=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/B_SWlwfjgm1/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_campaign=loading\" data-instgrm-version=\"12\" style=\" background:#FFF;

This is in sync with our vision to build multi-generational wealth.</p><p><em><em><strong><strong>What is required to be part of the MAD ‚Äî Challenge?</strong></strong></em></em></p><p>3 Traits are required. A consistent savings habit, of delayed gratification, on a monthly basis; a long-term, minimum 10 years, investment horizon; and a compounding mindset that brings about wealth.</p><p><em><em><strong><strong>How do I join the MAD ‚Äî Challenge?</strong></strong></em></em></p><ol><li><strong><strong>Signup Up </strong></strong>for an <a href=\"http://investnaira.com/Signup\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Invest Naira Account here</a></li><li>On the dashboard, create a <strong><strong>New Goal </strong></strong>titled ‚ÄúMillionaire A Decade ‚Äî MAD‚Äù</li><li>Set the <strong><strong>maturity </strong></strong>to 10 Years ‚Äî Dec 31, 2030.</li><li>Insert the <strong><strong>goal amount </strong></strong>based on the monthly commitment you can stick to.

So yes, you should save for a minimum of 10 years. Figures in year 10 are projected figures based on calculations and not cast in stone.</p><p><em><em><strong><strong>How much can I start with?</strong></strong></em></em></p><p>For the MAD Challenge, a minimum NGN5,000 set aside monthly is required to achieve millionaire status.</p><p><em><em><strong><strong>Can I aim for more ‚Äî multi-millionaire, centi-millionaire?</strong></strong></em></em></p><p>Of course, be our guest.

Our figures are based on an estimate of 1.8% per month or 24% compounded per year. Figures would fluctuate on a monthly, quarterly and yearly basis. We do not guarantee it, but we are confident the ride to the million a decade would be worth every month journeyed.</p><p><em><em><strong><strong>Can I withdraw if I am no longer interested?</strong></strong></em></em></p><p>Yes, you can. However, you are giving up on the opportunity to be a millionaire by the end of the decade. Withdrawals are subject to terms and conditions.</p><p><em><em><strong><strong>How am I sure one day, InvestNaira would not sink?</strong></strong></em></em></p><p>There is a risk in this voyage, like any other voyage in renaissance times.

We are disillusioned by the goals we have projected for the year. We write some daring targets, only to be stymied by various headwinds against their accomplishments. It‚Äôs like having an iPhone X goal and finding yourself with a Sagem-V55 device after the first 90 days.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://nairasense.investnaira.com/content/images/2020/07/image-5.png\" class=\"kg-image\"></figure><p>The iPhone is what we life should look like when we set them goals on Jan 1, 2020. The Sagem V-55 is what life looks like at the end of the second quarter of 2020. Oh, to New Year resolutions without daily actions!!!</p><p>Well, do not give up just yet on those goals. Dreams without discipline and commitment would end as an illusion. It is important always to take disciplined consistent daily actions to achieve our long-term objectives. And that is what we do every single day at InvestNaira. For if you take <em><em>daily disciplined committed </em></em>steps, your iPhone might as well be the Ipone Xr. Far beyond what you can ask, think or imagine!</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://nairasense.investnaira.com/content/images/2020/07/image-4.png\" class=\"kg-image\"></figure><p><strong><strong>3 Years is the Short Term.</strong></strong></p><p>30 years ago, we sent mail (courier) once a month.<br>20 years ago, we sent an e-mail once a day.<br>10 years ago, we posted on social media once an hour.<br>Today, we chat with social tools every minute.</p><p>In the social media world of communication, a day is too long a time to wait to get a response. For communication, we can deduce, the short term is a second; the Medium-term is a Minute; the Long Term is an hour. An hour is now eons ago! Choi.</p><p>In building a Financial ark however, we must not use as a yardstick, the disruption of communication via the medium of technology. Rather, the age-old principle of seed-time &amp; harvest remains on the earth. A baby is delivered after 36 weeks in the womb. Shortening a baby‚Äôs life cycle might cause deformity. It is against the seed-time and harvest cycle.</p><blockquote><em><em><strong><strong>‚ÄòYou Can‚Äôt</strong></strong> Produce a <strong><strong>Baby</strong></strong> in One <strong><strong>Month by Getting Nine Women Pregnant</strong></strong></em></em></blockquote><p>Let‚Äôs cue in the agricultural life cycle. Annual crops produce fruits within a year. And you have to replant them yearly, season by season. Perennial crops, however, produce fruits that could span years after their first fruits harvest. Think Cocoa ‚Äî it takes between 3 to 5 year for its first fruits. Or Palm Tree ‚Äî it takes 4 to 6 years for its first fruits. The difference, though, between annual and perennial crops lie in the fruits. Once the perennial crop yields it‚Äôs first fruits, they re-produce for decades. We want to plant financial seeds that produce for decades and generations.</p><p><strong><strong>OUR RETURNS Q1</strong></strong></p><p>Returns at Q1 are given below for the various funds.</p><blockquote><em><em>For three years it‚Äôs fruits will be off-limits to you; it must not be eaten.</em></em></blockquote><p>In the world of Finance, the value of assets fluctuate as the waves of the sea. Our holding an asset for multiple quarters means they are not liquidated at quarter‚Äôs end. This, therefore, means the values of assets would move like the waves of the sea in positive or negative directions. If we stay with the right asset, then we expect more upside than downside. Our challenge in building a financial ark is catching the right asset and sticking with it as it fluctuates. For, the longer we stick in the right direction, the greater the returns.</p><p><strong><strong>INCH BY INCH</strong></strong></p><p>It‚Äôs has been whipped one time too many that Rome was not built in a day. But may we add, there was not a day that Rome was not built.</p><p><em><em><strong><strong>Yard by Yard. Life‚Äôs Hard. Inch by Inch, everything is a cinch.</strong></strong></em></em></p><p>If we looked at the goal on the first day of the first year, building a financial ark was hardddd. Daringly so! Ask the foremost ark builder, Father Noah. But as we faced down, hands to the spindle, browbeaten and never giving in, <em><em>still we rise! </em></em>Against odds, lots &amp; slots, we rose and advanced. Our mantra, inch by inch, day by passing day, with you, the financial ark becomes a cinch!</p><p>Dear INer, this is our submission to you. Your journey with us on the short term is a three-year commitment of consistent daily discipline of saving. For it is that perennial perspective that yields the first fruits of the results of many decades.</p><p>For, after 3 years, the seeds of our inch-by-inch stance might begin to produce. Then, the assurance of our shared vision and the substance of the hoped-for-future has turned word to flesh!</p><p>Our short term view is the three-year mark. The three year time-frame lies the seed of the 8th wonder of the world ‚Äî compound wealth.</p><hr><p>Save | Invest | Don''t-Pluck.</p>",
